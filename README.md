# BedrockWaters
BedrockWaters is a client-side mod which simply ports over the Minecraft Bedrock Edition exclusive feature of biome specific water colors in order to give each biome a more unique atmosphere. Its purpose is simply aesthetic and had no other features besides changing water colors (although it feels like a more significant change in-game). All changed biome water colors can be found on the Minecraft Wiki [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Water#Bedrock_Edition).
