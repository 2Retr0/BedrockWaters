# BedrockWaters

BedrockWaters is a client-side quality-of-life mod which ports over the exclusive water properties from Minecraft Bedrock Editionâ€”specifically:

## Features
<details><summary><b>Summary of features</b></summary>
    <ul>
	<li> <b> More biome-specific water colors as to give each a more unique atmosphere!</b> </li>
	<li> <b> More biome-specific underwater fog distance caps!</b> <em>(most of which further than Vanilla).</em> </li>
	<li> <b> Biome-specific water opacity! </b><em>(contrasting murky swamps from clear mountains!).</em></li>
	<li> <b> Default water textures have been changed to match that of Bedrock Edition!</b> </li>
        <li> <b> Dynamic water color selection for modded biomes which use the default Vanilla water color!</b></li>
    </ul>
</details>

All features are purely aesthetic but together yield a significant visual change in-game. Most biome properties can be found on the Minecraft Wiki [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Water#Bedrock_Edition).
